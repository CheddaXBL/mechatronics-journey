Q1 — Electronics A 5.0 V supply drives an LED that needs 10 mA. What resistor is required? (show work) A1 - Step 1: Define Variables and Formula The problem provides the supply voltage (\(V_{s}=5.0\,V\)) and the desired current (\(I_{f}=10\,mA\)), which must be converted to Amperes (\(I_{f}=0.010\,A\)). The LED's specific forward voltage (\(V_{f}\)) is not given, so we assume a common value of \(V_{f}=2.0\,V\). The required series resistance (\(R\)) is determined by Ohm's Law, accounting for the voltage drop across both the resistor and the LED:\(R=(V_{s}-V_{f})/I_{f}\)Step 2: Substitute Values Substitute the known and assumed values into the equation:\(R=(5.0\,V-2.0\,V)/0.010\,A\)Step 3: Perform Calculation First, calculate the net voltage drop that the resistor must handle (\(V_{s}-V_{f}=3.0\,V\)), then divide by the current to find the resistance:\(R=3.0\,V/0.010\,A\)\(R=300\,\Omega \)
Q2 — Programming: Write a Python function (iterative or recursive) that returns factorial(n). Explain time complexity. A2 -
Q3 — Theory (short): What is PWM and why is it useful for motor control? (2–3 sentences) A2 - PWM, or Pulse Width Modulation, is a digital method for controlling the average power delivered to a device by rapidly switching the power on and off. It is useful for motor control because it allows for precise and efficient control of a motor's speed and direction by adjusting the "on" time, or duty cycle, of the pulses. This technique is efficient because it minimizes energy loss compared to methods that use variable resistance.
